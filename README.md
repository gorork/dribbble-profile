#Dribbble Profile

Dribbble Profile is a web module that showcases Dribbble player's profile together with his/her last shot.
I made this widget as [my debut shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/1452717-Freebie-Dribbble-Profile-web-module) on Dribbble to give something valuable to all Dribbble players.

## Usage

To use it, simply copy the following line of code and enter **your Dribbble username** instead of mine `rork`:

```
    <script src="//nadikun.com/code/drbbbl-profile/dp-loader.js" data-dribbble-id="rork" async></script>
```

Check how **your profile** would look like using [LIVE DEMO](http://nadikun.com/code/drbbbl-profile/)

You can insert this code on any page of your website. 
Just paste the code to the place on a page where you'd like this widget to appear.
Here is [live example](http://nadikun.com/about/) in my Jekyll blog. You can use it with Wordpress or any other platforms.
